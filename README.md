# AI Lab Assignments: The AI Odyssey üåå
Welcome to a captivating journey through the dynamic world of Artificial Intelligence. In this repository, we explore a diverse range of AI experiments, each showcasing a unique blend of theory and application. Dive deep into the world of genetics, optimization, and deep learning. Each lab is a narrative, a story waiting to be told.

## üß¨ Lab 1A & 1B: Genetic Algorithms - Nature's Codebook
In Lab 1A and 1B, we delve into the mysterious realm of genetic algorithms. Experience evolution in action, from basic crossover types to the intricacies of the N-Queens puzzle. Watch genes change over generations and visualize their impact. It's nature's way of coding, and we're just beginning to unravel the magic.

## üß™ Lab 2: Evolution's Next Step
Taking our exploration of genetic algorithms a step further in Lab 2, we uncover advanced mutation techniques and dive into the world of niching. Discover the FITNESS_SHARING, CROWDING, and SPECIATION methods, each adding a unique flavor to the genetic mix. And then there's the EXAPTATION Algorithm, a harmonious blend of co-evolution optimizing dual functions. Evolution has never been this exciting!

## üöö Lab 3: The Road to Optimal
The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is more than just a challenge; it's an adventure. In Lab 3, we marry KMeans clustering with 2-opt algorithms, creating a power couple in the world of optimization. Delve into the intricacies of Tabu Search and explore the dynamic world of Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (ALNS). It's all about finding the best routes, one step at a time.

## üï∏Ô∏è Experiment 4: Co-evolution's Ballet
Experiment 4 takes us to the enthralling world of sorting networks. Drawing inspiration from nature's balance, we delve into networks where simple processors decide the fate of numbers. Add to that Danny Hillis' genius approach of co-evolution simulations, and you witness a whole new dimension to sorting. It's a dance of numbers, and every step is a marvel.

## ü§ñ Experiment 5: Where Deep Learning Meets Reinforcement
Last but not least, Experiment 5 is where the worlds of deep learning and reinforcement collide. Crafted meticulously using the Gym environment for the sorting network challenge, we venture into the neural adventures with DQN. It's a world where AI learns, adapts, and evolves, guided by intricate reward mechanisms. The future is here, and it's enthralling!



Join the Odyssey: Every lab, every experiment, is a chapter in the grand saga of AI exploration. So, pull up a chair, dive in, and embark on this exhilarating journey with us.
